D-893 requires a minimum of 500 cfs between September 15 and December 31 and 250 cfs from January through mid-September. During critically dry periods (when unimpaired inflows to Folsom Reservoir from April and September fall below 600 TAF) minimum flows can decrease by 25%. In the table, for each month, the D-893 year type can be either Not Critically Dry (\"1\") or Critically Dry (\"2\"). Example: For October (Month = \"1\"), if conditions are not critically dry (D-893 index is \u201c1\u201d), D-893 calls for a 500 cfs minimum as it falls within the mid-September to December timeframe. However, under critically dry conditions (\u201c2\u201d), flow requirements decrease by 25%. Therefore, the minimum flow required becomes 375 cfs for the month.

Dustin Jones/SRS (Updated) Date: 11-22-99/12-10-99 Description: Based on State Water Resources Control Board Decision 893 (D-893) which was enacted in 1958 as a pre-CVPIA measure to provide fish protection by applying minimum flow requirements along the Lower American River. D-893 requires a minimum of 500 cfs between September 15 and December 31 and 250 cfs from January through mid-September. During critically dry periods (when unimpaired inflows to Folsom Reservoir from April and September fall below 600 TAF) minimum flows can decrease by 25%. In the table, for each month, the D-893 year type can be either Not Critically Dry (\"1\") or Critically Dry (\"2\"). Example: For October (Month = \"1\"), if conditions are not critically dry (D-893 index is \u201c1\u201d), D-893 calls for a 500 cfs minimum as it falls within the mid-September to December timeframe. However, under critically dry conditions (\u201c2\u201d), flow requirements decrease by 25%. Therefore, the minimum flow required becomes 375 cfs for the month.
