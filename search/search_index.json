Carryover water is stored in the SWP\u2019s share of San Luis Reservoir, when space is available, for the contractor to use in the following year. Central Valley Project (CVP) Operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the CVP is a water storage and delivery system consisting of 20 dams and reservoirs (including Shasta, Folsom, and New Melones Reservoirs), 11 power plants, and 500 miles of major canals. CVP facilities reach some 400 miles from Redding to Bakersfield and deliver about 7 million acre-feet of water for agricultural, urban, and wildlife use. cubic feet per second (cfs) A measure of the rate at which a river of stream is flowing. The flow is 1 cfs if a cubic foot (about 7.48 gallons) of water passes a specific point in 1 second. A flow of 1 cubic foot per second for a day is approximately 2 acre-feet.

No permit is required to use this water, which must be used on riparian (adjacent) land and cannot be stored for later use State Water Project (SWP) Operated by DWR, a water storage and delivery system of 33 storage facilities, about 700 miles of open canals and pipelines, four pumping-generating plants, five hydroelectric power plants, and 20 pumping plants that extends for more than 600 miles in California. Its main purpose is to store and distribute water to 29 urban and agricultural water suppliers in Northern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, the San Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast, and Southern California. The SWP provides supplemental water to 25 million Californians (almost twothirds of California\u2019s population) and about 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. Water deliveries have ranged from 1.4 million acre-feet in a dry year to more than 4.0 million acre-feet in a wet year. SWP contractors Twenty-nine entities that receive water for agricultural or municipal and industrial uses through the SWP. Each contractor has executed a long-term water supply contract with DWR.

Table A Water The maximum amount of SWP water that the State agreed to make available to an SWP contractor for delivery during the year. Table A amounts determine the maximum water a contractor may request each year from DWR.

This table was developed using model iterations and also serves to fine tune allocations (which are influenced by seasonal conditions) and to limit shortages simulated in the model. For example, estimates may change due to wet/flood year conditions on the San Joaquin River which may lead to higher export capacity for the months of April, May, and June. Source: Export Estimatev2 (DOCX) featherfish_058 Author: None Date: None Description: Flow below Thermalito must not exceed 2500 cfs between October 15 and November 30 (except in the case of flood release). Otherwise this will trigger a 500 cfs increase in required flows to the end of March (to prevent dewatering of spawning sites). To avoid this, CalSim uses a 4000 cfs constraint on flows for October.and a 2500 cfs limit in November. See example for an explanation for the October constraint. Example: A 4000 cfs requirement for all of October provides for a partial month requirement of less than 2500 cfs from Oct 15 to Oct 31 (17 days) and from Oct 1 to Oct 14 (14 days).

If January 8RI greater than (or equal to) 1.5 MAF, the February E:I ratio is 0.35, If it is less than (or equal to) 1.0 MAF, February E:I ratio is 0.45.

D-893 requires a minimum of 500 cfs between September 15 and December 31 and 250 cfs from January through mid-September. During critically dry periods (when unimpaired inflows to Folsom Reservoir from April and September fall below 600 TAF) minimum flows can decrease by as much as 50%. In the table, for each month, the D-893 year type can be either Not Critically Dry (\"1\") or Critically Dry (\"2\"). Example: For September (Month = \"12\"), if conditions are not critically dry (D-893 index is \u201c1\u201d), D-893 calls for a 250 cfs minimum for the first part of the month, then a 500 cfs minimum for the latter half (averaging out to 375 cfs for the entire month).

The following describe the minimum flow agreements applied by this table: Davis-Grunsky Agreement: Provides a miniumum flow of 180 to 220 cfs in the Merced River between Crocker-Huffman diversion dam and Shaffer Bridge from November through March every year for fall-run Chinook salmon. Davis-Grunsky Act requirements are assumed to be 220 cfs in non-dry years, per the FERC definition. In FERC dry years, the Davis-Grunsky Act requirement is modeled as 180 cfs. The existing FERC license defines a \u201cnormal\u201d or \"non-dry\" year as when the May 1 DWR Bulletin 120 forecasted April through July inflow to Lake McClure is greater than 450,000 AF, and a \u201cdry\u201d year when inflow is forecasted to be less than 450,000 AF. The Cowell Agreement, calls for \u2014Merced ID to provide releases from Crocker-Huffman diversion dam up to the following flows for use by the Cowell Agreement diverters at 11 locations: 100 cfs in March; 175 cfs in April; 225 cfs in May; 250 cfs in June until the flow of the Merced River falls below 1,200 cfs; 225 cfs flow for the next 31 days; 175 cfs flow for the next 31 days; 150 cfs for the next 30 days; and 50 cfs thereafter or the natural inflow into Lake McClure, whichever is less, through the last day of February. The FERC license requires a specific flow at Shaffer Bridge, approximately 20 miles downstream from Crocker-Huffman. Flows vary by month and water year type between 15-100 cfs. The following schedule for these flows (dependent on year type) are as follows: Normal Year (cfs) Dry Years (cfs) June 1 through October 15 25 15 October 16 through October 31 75 60 November 1 through December 31 100 75 January 1 through May 31 75 60 Example: For the month of October, the flow requirement is calculated using monthly averaging, combining flow (cfs) with the corresponding number of days (d): Normal Year (25 cfs(15d)+75 cfs (16d))/31d = 50.81 cfs Dry Year (15 cfs(15d)+60 cfs(16d))/31d = 38.23 cfs Source: feis_master_sent2ferc (PDF) applied below dams located on the South Fork of the American River as part of the El Dorado Hydroelectric Project (FERC No.184).

Davis-Grunsky Act requirements are assumed to be 220 cfs in non-dry years, per the FERC definition. In FERC dry years, the Davis-Grunsky Act requirement is modeled as 180 cfs. The existing FERC license defines a \u201cnormal\u201d or \"non-dry\" year as when the May 1 DWR Bulletin 120 forecasted April through July inflow to Lake McClure is greater than 450,000 AF, and a \u201cdry\u201d year when inflow is forecasted to be less than 450,000 AF. The Cowell Agreement, calls for \u2014Merced ID to provide releases from Crocker-Huffman diversion dam up to the following flows for use by the Cowell Agreement diverters at 11 locations: 100 cfs in March; 175 cfs in April; 225 cfs in May; 250 cfs in June until the flow of the Merced River falls below 1,200 cfs; 225 cfs flow for the next 31 days; 175 cfs flow for the next 31 days; 150 cfs for the next 30 days; and 50 cfs thereafter or the natural inflow into Lake McClure, whichever is less, through the last day of February. The FERC license requires a specific flow at Shaffer Bridge, approximately 20 miles downstream from Crocker-Huffman. Flows vary by month and water year type between 15-100 cfs.

The Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement (SMPA) was signed by Reclamation, DWR, DFG, and SRCD in 1987, contains provisions to mitigate the effects of the SWP and CVP operations on Suisun Marsh channel water salinity. It required Reclamation and DWR to meet salinity standards specified in the then-current State Water Board D-1485 (the SMPA was amended in 2005). As part of the SMPA, the EC threshold at Martinez (MTZ) for triggering SMSCG operation for D-1641 and SMPA ( Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement) is the last 7-day average MTZ EC value of previous month in mmhos/cm.
