# CalSim 3 Documentation

CalSim 3 is a new and improved water resources planning model, jointly developed by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the Mid-Pacific Region of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), to simulate operations of the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP) and much of the water resources infrastructure in the Central Valley of California and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. It is the next generation of the CalSim-II model which has been used in various Central Valley water resources planning studies since its release in 2002.
