**Description:**
This is the Export/Inflow ratio imposed monthly by D-1641 to protect migrating fish species by limiting the proportion of Delta inflow that is exported. The E:I ratio is 0.35 from March to June and 0.65 for the remaining months.  The February E:I ratio (0.0 in the table) can vary from 0.35 to 0.45 depending on the amount of January runoff (February E:I is determined by another table: "FebEIratio").

**Description:**
This helps determine the End-of-May storage target for the American River Flow Management Standards. The American River Index (ARI) is an indicator of unimpaired Folsom inflow and is based on DWR's Bulletin 120.  The End-of-May storage target is derived from linear interpolation of the ARI.

**Description:**
Flow below Thermalito must not exceed 2500 cfs between October 15 and November 30 (except in the case of flood release).  Otherwise this will trigger a 500 cfs increase in required flows to the end of March (to prevent dewatering of spawning sites). To avoid this, CalSim uses a 4000 cfs constraint on flows for October.and a 2500 cfs limit in November.  See example for an explanation for the October constraint.

Example:  A 4000 cfs requirement for all of October provides for a partial month requirement of less than 2500 cfs from Oct 15 to Oct 31 (17 days) => 4000 cfs times (17d/31d) and from Oct 1 to Oct 14 (14 days) => 4000 cfs time (14d/31d).

## Feb_snowmelt_release_pattern
## FebEiRatio
**Author:** None  
**Date:**  None

**Description:**
February Export/Inflow ratio (E:I) depends on January Eight River Index (8RI),  The January 8RI is the sum of unimpaired flow from the Sacramento River at Bend Bridge, Feather River at Oroville, Yuba River at Smartville, American River at Folsom, plus the Stanislaus River inflow to New Melones Lake, Tuolumne River inflow to New Don Pedro Reservoir, Merced River inflow to Lake McClure, and San Joaquin River inflow to Millerton Lake. If January 8RI greater than (or equal to) 1.5 MAF, the February E:I ratio is 0.35, If it is less than (or equal to) 1.0 MAF, February E:I ratio is 0.45. All ratios in between are derived through interpolation.

**Description:**
Based on State Water Resources Control Board Decision 893 (D-893) which was enacted in 1958 as a pre-CVPIA measure to provide fish protection by applying minimum flow requirements along the Lower American River.  D-893 requires a minimum of 500 cfs between September 15 and December 31 and 250 cfs from January through mid-September. During critically dry periods (when unimpaired inflows to Folsom Reservoir from April and September fall below 600 TAF) minimum flows can decrease by as much as 50%.  In the table, for each month, the D-893 year type can be either Not Critically Dry ("1") or Critically Dry ("2"). 

Example:  For September (Month = "12"), if conditions are not critically dry (D-893 index is “1”), D-893 calls for a 250 cfs minimum for the first part of the month, then a 500 cfs minimum for the latter half (averaging out to 375 cfs for the entire month).
