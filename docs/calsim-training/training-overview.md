# CalSim On-Demand Training
Welcome! The California Department of Water Resources Modeling Support Office hosted a 6 session, 18-hour CalSim 3 fundamentals training workshop in Winter 2025 to provide participants with an overview of WRIMS and CalSim 3.

Topics covered during the workshop ranged from a high-level conceptual understanding of CalSim 3 to ground-level code implementation of facilities, hydrology, regulations, and operations.

At the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:   

1. Understand the role of CalSim 3 and its application as a planning model 
2. Obtain an overview of the CVP-SWP system as it is modeled in CalSim 3 
3. Identify key assumptions and limitations of the model 
4. Understand hydrology development in CalSim 3, including sources of Input Data 
5. Understand how the Delta and its requirements are simulated within CalSim 3 
6. Understand how reservoirs and allocations are simulated within CalSim 3 
7. Analyze and Interpret Study results, including post-processing tools
