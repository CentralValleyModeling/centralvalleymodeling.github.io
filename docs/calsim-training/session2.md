| [Rim Watersheds – Hydrology](https://cadwr.box.com/s/h867kij8niienu618a6hye377s6525vs)  | Rim inflows are surface water flows from the mountain watersheds that surround the Central Valley. This video describes the representation and implementation of rim inflows and provides an example rim inflow spreadsheet walkthrough.  | Bridget Childs | N/A | [Quiz](https://forms.office.com/g/EV9dhpVRmF?origin=lprLink) |
| [Upper Watersheds – Overview](https://cadwr.box.com/s/tuflnsv5k5gd67bj5q0z7qbs3zxqyxau)  | Upper watersheds reside above the valley floor boundary and provide the main supply of water for Sacramento Valley users. This talk explains the motivation, components, integration, and data flow of upper watershed modules in CalSim 3.  | Andy Draper | N/A | N/A |
| [Delta Hydrology ](https://cadwr.box.com/s/2i41bhlouo5uw39p544qx95b7tknyg30)  |  Delta water supplies and water demands are represented as the net effect of diversion, seepages, and drainages on Delta channels in seven subregions. This talk describes the representation of in-Delta water supplies and water use based on DWR’s Delta Channel Depletion model. | Mohammad Hasan | N/A | [Quiz](https://forms.office.com/g/UhcMZz4r9G?origin=lprLink) |
