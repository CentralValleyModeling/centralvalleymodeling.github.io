## AgReuse
Agricultural Reuse by demand unit for rice lands

Month 1 = October

Calculation of TW/AW does not include drawdow during May and September

Initial flood-up: 40% April, 60% May

April Case (b): No irrigation.

April Case (a): No tailwater. Irrigation for 3" soil saturation, 3" flood-up prior to planting

May Case (b): Irrigation for 5.4" ETc, 3" initial ponding, 3" to saturate soil, 3" ponding after drawdown, 1.275" lateral flow (half-month). 0.225" deep percolation (half-month). 0.9" flow-through

May Case (a): Irrigation for 8.1" ETc, 3" ponding after drawdown, 2.55" lateral flow. 0.45" deep percolation. 0.9" flow-through

June: Irrigation for 9.5" ETc, 2" incremental ponding, 2.55" lateral flow. 0.45" deep percolation. No flow-through (lock-up)

July: Irrigation for 9.4" ETc, 3" incremental ponding, 2.55" lateral flow. 0.45" deep percolation. 1.8" flow-through.

August: Irrigation for 7.8" ETc, 0" incremental ponding, 2.55" lateral flow. 0.45" deep percolation. 1.8" flow-through.

September:  Irrigation (first 15 days)for 2.7" ETc, 0" incremental ponding, 0" lateral flow. 0" deep percolation. 0.9" flow-through.

In September, water levels fall during first 15 days due to lateral flow and deep percolation.
