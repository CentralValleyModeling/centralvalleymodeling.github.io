## CVPSL_fill_targets
CVPSL fill targets are set conservatively in Oct-Dec

In January, if Shasta is above 3250 it can release flow for storage in CVPSL

But as the year advances, the threshold for targeting CVPSL fill rises to

4000 by March, and inversely, the filling target when shasta is at 3250

decreases to 672 by April.
