Created spreadsheet "Result.FebEiRatio" in "waterYearIndex.xlsx" ---- by Idy Lui (8/2015)

Use January 8-River Index (8RI) for every year

If Jan 8RI >= 1.5 MAF, the Feb EI ratio was 0.35,

If Jan 8RI <= 1.0 MAF, the Feb EI ratio was 0.45.

Any value between them was derived by linear interpolation.
