## MRR_Schedule
Minimum Release Requirement for the Modified FMS

Implementation Curve uses AMF FNF WY - Folsom Spill

American River Index = WY_FNF_spill2  which is the full natural flow into Folsom Res for the water year minus the spill from Folsom (assume spill occurs anytime storage is greater than 8000 cfs?)

January (month 4) uses the SRI as the index rather than ARI.
