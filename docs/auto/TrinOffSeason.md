## TrinOffSeason
During October, Trinity Imports are used to move warm water out of Lewiston and

make releases of cooler water from Trinity for temperature considerations on the Trinity River.

During Nov - Feb, Trinity Imports are only available if Trinity is likely to spill.

Trinity Import Values scaled from the maximum Trinity Imports during the 2010 - 2020 historical record.
