11/13/03 Hilts (FWS):  Nov 20, 1997 Stability Criteria for Sacramento River below Keswick revised significantly to best represent FWS mgt of b2 under the May03 DOI B2 Decision for planning simulation use only.

fraction = fraction of previous month's flow to maintain in the current month (if other criteria doesn't call for more). (pct)
