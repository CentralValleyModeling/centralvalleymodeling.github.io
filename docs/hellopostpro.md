# Post-Processing Tools
Congratulations, you've run CalSim! Now, let's help you make sense of the results.  
When a CalSim run is completed, the outputs will reside in a [Decision Variable (DV) DSS file](modelsetup.md#decision-variable-dv-output-files)

# 1. PDF Report Tool
The PDF Report tool is a summary report generator to compare two CalSim 3 DV files. It is among the most commonly used tools to quickly compare the differences of two CalSim 3 studies. The PDF Report tool can be launched using through WRIMS.

# 2. Excel Tools
!!! Note
    To use these tools, you will need to install the HEC DSS Add-In. The installer can be downloaded here: 

Excel spreadsheet tools are the most flexible tools to review CalSim 3 results. There are many tools developed to review different areas of the model. The list of tools below is not exhaustive; there have been many tools developed to accomodate different post-processing needs.

### a. Trend Report
The "Swiss Army Knife" of CalSim 3 post-processing tools.

### b. Delivery Capability Report One Pager
This tool is used to develop the high-level summary tables used in the Delivery Capability Reports

### c. Control Spreadsheet
For a deeper dive into the operations. Identifies the controlling factors in the models (e.g., Delta salinity requirements, pumping constraints, reservoir operations).
